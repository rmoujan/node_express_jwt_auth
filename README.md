## Technologies Used:

- [Node.js] : Node.js is a popular open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code server-side
- [Express.js] :Express.js is a minimalistic and flexible web application framework for Node.js, designed to build web applications and APIs quickly and easily. It provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications, including routing, middleware support, template engines, and much more.
- [MongoDB] : MongoDB is a popular open-source, NoSQL (non-relational) database management system designed for modern application development. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, making it easy to work with and scale for a wide range of use cases.)
- [Ejs] : or Embedded JavaScript, is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. It's often used with Node.js and Express.js to generate dynamic HTML content on the server-side.
